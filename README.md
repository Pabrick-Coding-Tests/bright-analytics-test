##Bright Analytics - Test

**Task 1**
Inspect the provided json object and write code which re-shapes it into a data structure suitable for rendering the tabular report shown at the bottom of this document.

**Task 2**
Write a function which, given an array of strings and a metric ID (int), will return a numeric value (float). The function should be able to handle a tree of any depth.

For example, using the provided json data a suitable call to the function would look like this;

'
Function call: extractValueFromTree([“PPC – Brand”, “2016-10-10 (Mon)”], 141)
Result:  8.597356826336
'

**Notes:**
- Your solutions do not have to be perfect or even necessarily fully functional but are intended to provide a starting point for conversations during interview.
- Your solutions give us an opportunity to judge the depth of your technical knowledge and capabilities.

**Hint:** *The json object intentionally contains a lot of attributes which are not relevant to these tasks!*
